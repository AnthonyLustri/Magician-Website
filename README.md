## 📱 Mobile Optimization

The site was carefully optimized for mobile devices:

* Responsive SVG scaling (no text clipping)
* Mobile-friendly navigation menu
* Touch-safe buttons and cards
* Reduced hover effects on touch devices
* Fallback handling for mobile video autoplay restrictions

---

## ♻️ Maintainability

The codebase was written to be **easy to update**:

* Clear section separation in HTML
* Centralized styling in the `<style>` block
* Reusable components (cards, sections, reviews)
* JavaScript limited to essential interactions

Future updates (new images, reviews, shows, or text) can be done directly in the HTML without refactoring.

* Backend form handling (email or serverless)
* CMS integration for reviews & gallery
* Performance optimization with compressed video formats
* SEO metadata and structured data
